<q>“Around here, however, we don’t look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing
new things, because we're curious… and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.” — 
<cite><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" target="_blank">Walt Disney</a></cite></q>

I think looking backwards and knowing where we come from is very important for an artist. This is why I am very
interested in traditional art and like to go to museums. Further, I chose to study because I wanted to have a solid
theoretical background for my professional work as an artist.

However, it is most important for me to keep moving forward – improving my skills, trying out different styles, and
learning new techniques. This is why I always search for new things to fuel my creativity, and constantly look at new
technologies. I am also very passionate about being an artist in the games industry, and part of that community.

It is my curiosity that always leaves me wanting to learn and experience more. And I am very curious about the new paths
it will lead me down in the future. If you are curious too, contact me to learn more about my personality and passions:
