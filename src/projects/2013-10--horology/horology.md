## Personal Experience
This project was a rendering assignment during my master studies. The assignment was about recreating the look of actual
 photographs by photographer
 <a href="http://www.mingthein.photography/horology/" href-lang="en" target="_blank">Ming Thein</a>. An existing 3D
 model of a wrist watch was positioned in Autodesk Maya. The main focus of the assignment was to add lighting and
 shading to the scene, and to set up the render settings. The images were rendered with V-Ray including different render
 passes. Finally, Nuke was used to do the compositing, and output the final images.
