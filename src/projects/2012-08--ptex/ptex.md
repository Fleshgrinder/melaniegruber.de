## Personal Experience
I chose this topic for my bachelorʼs thesis because I am always interested in new technologies, and wanted to see how 
well Ptex (Per-Face Texture Mapping) is integrated into the Autodesk programs. During the practical part of the thesis I 
modeled a mermaid in Autodesk 3ds Max, sculpted additional detail, and created the Ptex texturing in Autodesk Mudbox. 
During this work I learned a lot about human modeling. Finally, I exported the Ptex textures and rendered the model in 
Autodesk Maya with Mental Ray.

## Project Summary
My bachelorʼs thesis “Ptex: Per-Face Texture Mapping in Theory and Practice” evaluated the technology behind Ptex and 
its integration into current Autodesk programs. For that purpose I compared the already existing texture mapping 
methods, and covered the theoretical background of Ptex. The thesis also includes a practical part, where the workflows 
with Ptex and with UV-Layouts are compared.
