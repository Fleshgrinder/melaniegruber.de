## Personal Experience
I created the character design of the main character, and made digital paintings of him in various clothes and
situations. Further, I created all the characters with which the user can interact. The animations are very basic and
are used in the app to let the characters talk or give feedback to the user. This was the first project where I painted
digitally in Adobe Photoshop using a graphics tablet and so I had a very steep learning curve.

## Project Summary
This app is for children of preschool age. It helps the children to observe and distinguish the different initial
sounds. The character Pino guides players through the different mini games and various environments.
