## Personal Experience
I chose this topic for my bachelor’s thesis because I am always interested in new technologies, and wanted to see how
well Ptex (Per-Face Texture Mapping) is integrated into the Autodesk programs. During the practical part of the thesis I
modeled a mermaid in Autodesk 3ds Max, sculpted additional detail and created the Ptex texturing in Autodesk Mudbox.
During this work I learned a lot about human modeling.

## Project Summary
My bachelor’s thesis “Ptex: Per-Face Texture Mapping in Theory and Practice” evaluated the technology behind Ptex and
its integration into current Autodesk programs. For that purpose I compared the already existing texture mapping
methods, and covered the theoretical background of Ptex. The thesis also includes a practical part, where the workflows
with Ptex and with UV-Layouts are compared.
