## Personal Experience
I started to create this game character to get more experience using Autodesk Mudbox and Normal Maps. I designed the
 character myself, and created the low-poly 3D model using Autodesk 3ds Max. I then transferred the model to Autodesk
 Mudbox, and sculpted additional detail. The next steps in this project will be to extract the Normal Map, texture the
 character, and set up the shaders.
