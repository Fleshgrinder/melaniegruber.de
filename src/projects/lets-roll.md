An ostrich walks through the steppe, when suddenly a mysterious ball falls from the sky. Curiously the ostrich
approaches the ball and starts to pick on it. The ball shrinks with each pick of the ostrich and tries to
escape. But as soon as the ball is small enough the ostrich swallows it – now everything happens very fast.
