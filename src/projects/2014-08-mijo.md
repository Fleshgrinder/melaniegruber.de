## Personal Experience
This project started as a character design assignment for a seminar during my bachelor studies. For this seminar I made
the analog drawings. I later decided to continue to work on this project as an exercise in making model sheets in Adobe
Photoshop and creating a 3D character from a 2D design in Autodesk 3ds max, including the shaders.
