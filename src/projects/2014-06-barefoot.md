## Personal Experience
I mainly worked on the stylized textures of this game project, painting them in Adobe Photoshop with a graphics tablet.
During this work I learned a lot about how surface structures and tileable textures can be created. I also did some low
poly modeling of ingame assets in Autodesk 3ds max. This helped me to understand the special demands of game projects
and the techniques used to create objects with a low poly count.

## Project Summary
In this racing game the player does not drive a car, but runs with different creatures across the race track. Further,
the player can build own creatures out of the individual body parts of various animals. The decision which parts the
player chooses, also affects the racing performance of the creature.
