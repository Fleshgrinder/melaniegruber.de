## Personal Experience
I created the concept for this short film for an assignment for a seminar during my bachelor studies. The story is based 
on a Peruvian legend. In the end, I really liked the story and the character designs, so I decided to continue to work 
on this project. I hope I will be able to create the complete short film during the next years because I think it will 
be a great experience, and a good way to improve my skills.

## Project Summary
An Incan silversmith is given the honor to work for the king, who gives him a huge amount of silver. But before he can 
start his work, the silver is stolen from him. The silversmith is desperate, as he is now facing certain death for 
losing the king’s silver. Suddenly a blind old woman comes to his hut, kneels down, and starts to cry. With wonder the 
silversmith realizes that the woman’s tears turn into drops of silver. However, it is the greed of the silversmith that 
turns this miracle into a nightmare …
