## Personal Experience
This project started as a character design assignment for a seminar during my bachelor studies. For this seminar I made 
the analog drawings. I later decided to continue to work on this project as an exercise in making model sheets in Adobe 
Photoshop, and creating a 3D character from a 2D design in Autodesk 3ds Max, including the Mental Ray shaders.
