This game mixes jump 'n' run with puzzle elements in a classical 2.5 D setting. Everything is constructed of
simple geometric forms, which creates an abstract world. The player can remove parts of the environment, and
use these parts to build new forms. This core mechanic helps the player to solve the puzzles and progress
through the game.
