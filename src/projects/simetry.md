This game mixes jump ’n’ run with puzzle elements in a classical 2.5 D setting. Everything is constructed of simple 
geometric forms, which creates an abstract world. The player can remove parts of the environment, and use these parts 
to build new forms. This core mechanic helps the player to solve the puzzles and progress through the game.
