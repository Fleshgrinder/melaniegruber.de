My bachelor’s thesis “Ptex: Per-Face Texture Mapping in Theory and Practice” is about the method of Per-Face
Texture Mapping (Ptex). For that purpose I compared the already existing texture mapping methods, and covered
the theoretical background of Ptex. The thesis also includes a practical part, where the workflows with Ptex
and with UV-Layouts are compared.
