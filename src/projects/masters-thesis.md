My master's thesis “Utilizing Animal Morphology to Enhance the Design and Animation of Digital Creatures” is
about the connection between biological and digital creatures. In the course of the work I developed a set of
guidelines, which stays undiminished by changes in technology. These guidelines provide artists with an
unified approach to the creation of realistic and stylized digital creatures.
