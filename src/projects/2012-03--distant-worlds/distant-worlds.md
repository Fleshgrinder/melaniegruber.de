## Personal Experience
I modeled various plants for this fulldome show in Autodesk 3ds Max at 
<a href="http://www.northdocks.com" href-lang="de" target="_blank">Northdocks</a>, 
including small plants and large trees. Therefore, I learned a lot about how organic structures can be created in 3D. 
For some of the trees I used particles to create the large amount of leaves, which was the first time that I set up a 
particle system.

## Project Summary
The show was created for a dome-based video projection environment that immerses the viewer. A journey to earth-like 
planets far away, showing how life on these foreign planets could have developed.
