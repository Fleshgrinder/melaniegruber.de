## Personal Experience
I decided on the topic of my master’s thesis because I was interested in how the knowledge of anatomy (or morphology)
can enhance the work of 3D artists. To set limits to the field of research I chose to concentrate on animals. Through
the writing of this thesis I learned a lot about anatomy, proportions, character design principles, and the technologies
behind digital creature development.

## Project Summary
My master's thesis “Utilizing Animal Morphology to Enhance the Design and Animation of Digital Creatures” is about the
connection between biological and digital creatures. In the course of the work I developed a set of guidelines, which
stays undiminished by changes in technology. These guidelines provide artists with an unified approach to the creation
of realistic and stylized digital creatures.
