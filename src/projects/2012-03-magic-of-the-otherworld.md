## Personal Experience
I modeled an old sailing ship for this fulldome show in Autodesk 3ds Max at
<a href="http://www.northdocks.com" href-lang="de" target="_blank">Northdocks</a>.
This was my first big modeling project. I researched a lot of references for the look of the ship, and the cordage of
the masts and sails. Further, I also textured and shaded the model using Vray. Finally, I made a cloth simulation for
the sails blowing in the wind.

## Project Summary
The show was created for a dome-based video projection environment that immerses the viewer. Aesthetic
computer-generated images of different natural environments - like snowy mountains, mysterious caves, and the wide ocean
- are arranged to the music of the harp, and combined with live-action footage of the harp player Christine HÃ¶gl.
